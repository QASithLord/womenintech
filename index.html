	<h1>Seattle Women in Tech Events, Groups, and Resources</h1>
	<p>Having problems finding women in tech events? Looking to network, but have no idea where to start? You've come to the right place! Over the last few years I've found several groups and attended various meetups, and I've created this page to help you out. Like all sites, this is a work in progress. It will change as new events are posted and as my front end development skills improve. You can find some of my musings on women in tech events, struggles in the tech world, and in the kitchen on my new blog, <a href="http://qasithlord.blogspot.com/">http://qasithlord.blogspot.com</a></p>
